# RedditScrape_r-psychonaut
Code used to pull Reddit threads for r/psychonaut project
I used RStudio and RedditExtractoR (https://github.com/ivan-rivera/RedditExtractor) to collect data from Reddit threads in the r/psychonaut subreddit for a project I am assisting my proefessor with at UAB. This repository contains the code used within RStudio to find and collect the thread data.
